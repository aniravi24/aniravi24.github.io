description: Not everything is worth working on.

As [Ethan Naluz](https://medium.com/u/89fcd3585f72) and I keep working on new projects, something we’ve found up until now is that we’ve never worked on something that we deeply cared about. We first worked on a robocall-blocking app called [Pepper](https://callpepper.co/#/), and then we worked on a product called [FoodFeed](https://foodfeed.live/), which was social media for foodies. We also worked on a few other things. While we learned a ton from building and built new skills each time, what we found was that as much as we could code all day, we didn’t feel a deep passion for anything we built. There was no founder-problem fit. We decided to go back to the drawing board and find something that mattered to us.
