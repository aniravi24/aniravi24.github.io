## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ani. My obsession is building great products and great product teams.

I like statically typed functional programming and open-source software (my current favorite library ecosystem is [Effect-TS](https://effect.website/) for TypeScript).

Computers were built to aid us - naturally, they should help us make better software.
