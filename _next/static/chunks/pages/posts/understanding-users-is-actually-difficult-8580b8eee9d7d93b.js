Even if you talk to your users, it’s difficult to predict what people will actually do, especially if your product is complex. You have to get really good at getting people to talk through how they do things and describe problems, rather than telling you the solution (let them do that too, but you probably won’t use their suggested solutions). If you don’t actively observe your users or ask them how they do things, you may never get feedback on how things are going."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(e.p,{children:"We found that after we talked to our users, we were astounded by how much inefficiency they dealt with using the software to do their day-to-day jobs without complaining.
