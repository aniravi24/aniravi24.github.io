This allows you to use your database as a job queue, that your javascript code can pull jobs from and do work. Additionally, if you check out the PostGraphile documentation, there are easy ways to extend your GraphQL schema so you can add your own queries and mutations, similar to how you might do it if you had to write your own schemas and resolvers.

Anything that runs through PostGraphile’s autogenerated schema (not necessarily custom stuff you’ve written) also avoids N+1 query problems, as your GraphQL query is parsed into a SQL query prior to running against your database, keeping things performant. I saved a ton of time building with PostGraphile, and you get lots of interesting benefits doing things through DB-driven design. You could build say, a user-facing API and admin API largely just by setting database permissions per table, without having to write entire APIs or dealing with security for it separately. You can build a lot more a lot faster, especially as you aren’t spending time in your REST APIs thinking specifically about what query you need to write to get certain data.
