We look at people that choose not to partake in things like drinking, doing drugs, casual sex, or partying, and see them as people that are “missing out”.

I got this horribly wrong in the past, almost inverting the prior sentence. To no surprise, I was unhappy as a result. I won’t ever be doing that again. If I’m by myself as a result, so be it. On that note, also recognize that other people have value. People are not Costco samples\xa0or\xa0tools\xa0to\xa0satiate\xa0your\xa0desires. Value the people in your life.

A lot of your life is spent working, and doing the work to be great at your craft comes at a cost — often a social one, as you will often choose sleep, peace of mind, and hard work over having a social life.
