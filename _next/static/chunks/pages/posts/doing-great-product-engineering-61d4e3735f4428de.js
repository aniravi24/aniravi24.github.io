It’s fundamental to how engineers express themselves. The teams that (often quietly) ship great products with small teams are principled first and foremost about the tools they choose, and playing to their strengths. This comes in many forms. For some teams, it’s using an obscure programming language no one has heard of (which tends to self-select for more hardcore/passionate programmers, aside from the unfair advantage the tooling itself may provide when driven by the right person). For others, this means pushing parts of a “conventional” stack much farther than people think you can (relying on a database like postgres to also hold a lot of business logic).

I like to describe a codebase as a living, dynamical system. A human being is an example of such a system - our bodies are constantly going through different processes to keep us alive, and we have to consciously do work to perform at an optimal level (go to the gym, sleep properly, eat well, etc.). Similar to how your body evolves when you go to the gym, the only thing that’s constant about a great codebase being built from the ground up is a need to evolve. This is probably a heretical statement, because I’ve seen many engineers praise great codebases on how little work needs to be done to them after things work. However, the reality of a small team or organization is that your work is just getting started, and more likely than not as your organization grows, you will need to evolve the codebase. The thing is, surprisingly often, engineers don’t seem to have the foresight to think about what the consequences are of choosing tools that are not suitable for a growing team, evolving problems, and evolving products. The tools you choose should allow you to confidently change any part of the system knowing that things are not going to break, and to iterate quickly. The truth about an early product is that you usually can’t (and shouldn’t) be solving scale problems at the beginning. You don’t have the resources to be solving problems that a larger team will be able to - but what you want is a setup that’s capable of being evolved/improved. You’re not going to get every decision right, but it should be fixable over time instead of feeling like it’s going to fall apart at any second. High-leverage tools that let you punch well above your weight are probably the biggest unlock an engineering team can have - the most incredible thing about choosing high-leverage tools is that they also have a much greater likelihood of attracting great engineers (ask your favorite designer if they would choose Microsoft Paint over Figma/Photoshop). My favorite high-leverage tool is a language with a powerful type system like TypeScript (which also happens to come with a ton of additional tooling, such as linters, formatters, monorepos, etc.)."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:"One potentially counterintuitive thing I’ve learned from working with great engineers is that good/great engineers can make fundamentally different decisions than mediocre engineers. Sometimes, mediocre engineers will judge a great engineer’s decision as a risky or bad decision, because they don’t have the skill to actually drive some of those decisions. For example, improving/rewriting things is commonplace with the right engineering team. Larger rewrites might still be less common, but deciding to improve something should just be part of how you operate. If an engineer wants to improve something in the codebase, they should be able to demonstrate that something can make things better and quickly get feedback from the team on whether to proceed. If it’s a larger change, they should be able to validate it within days/weeks, and not spend months making major changes that people can’t see the viability of. This iteration loop becomes even faster once your team aligns on your engineering principles and why you choose certain tools over others. On the first team I worked with, if someone could demonstrate improvement using a certain tool and got the team bought in, we would start moving to it (quickly weighing the tradeoff between time to migrate and resulting improvement). I would often do the initial slate of work myself so that I could build that muscle of constant, iterative improvement. The worst place to be is on a team where even minor decisions take forever - you’ll have multiple meetings to decide on things that should take all of five minutes for a good team to move forward on with minimal discussion. A constant desire to improve and iterate gets baked into your culture when engineers actually see things get better. Great engineers tend to their garden without being asked and can balance that with shipping product in a timely manner to users."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:"In a lot of poor codebases, things are often caught only by users in production. In any decent codebase, the feedback to the engineer on what they might be doing wrong or need to change is as real-time as possible (i.e. seeing the error in your editor/compiler as your working on it, or being able to visually see changes). As many issues as possible should be solved at this first layer of defense, and basically the only real tool in an engineer’s toolkit to currently do this reliably is a high-quality type system and linting. The next typical layers of defense are tests, then CI checks, then preview environments, then staging, QA, and so on and so forth. The thing is that most small teams don’t have time or the need to set up all of these layers of defense, so if you start from the first layers of defense on day 1, you’ll have a much easier time adding the remaining ones as needed (and have fewer issues to fix). I’ve also found that with poor tooling, it becomes painful to iterate on your product, the system grows increasingly brittle (hard to change and easily broken by any perturbation from the real world, such as users or external services), and user dissatisfaction increases over time."}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(o.p,{children:"It turns out when you get these details right, great things happen. It’s like an incredible domino effect. Great people want to come work with you, which results in more (and higher-quality) work getting done, more progress, more great people wanting to join… and before you know it you’ve increased the odds of success.

It’s not surprising that many of the larger startups and companies suck talent out of the ecosystem by offering them compensation that’s basically impossible for a smaller organization to beat.

The longer you wait, you’re unlikely to fundamentally change the DNA of an organization (which is what’s needed to build a great product) and fix all the fundamental issues which only get worse over time. No great engineer wants to be the person left holding the bag. It’s a gargantuan (maybe improbable) effort to “fix” a non-existent product culture once a company has already grown. Assuming your company lasts long enough to actually fix that in the first place. Do not delay on this decision. The longer you wait, you significantly decrease the likelihood of not just success, but surviving altogether.
