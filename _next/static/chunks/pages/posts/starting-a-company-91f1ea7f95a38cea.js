Funny enough, some of those same people later told me they weren’t sure if I was just a “networker” or going to work on anything. Most people only ever get far enough to say they want to start a company, and never take any steps whatsoever to do it. What felt different for me is that I simply chased after what was interesting to me, and was willing to put any amount of effort necessary to keep doing things that were interesting to me. This led to me to joining my first startup (after trying to start my own company but not knowing what to work on, which fizzled out after building a couple small apps), where I got a one-of-a-kind experience. I don’t think I appreciated how unusual my experience was until I talked to more people and learned about their backgrounds (as well as hearing from former teammates about their current roles).

What was going on? It took a lot of soul-searching, but I realized I had reached this unique mental state I’ve heard some founders describe, where you feel like you have to start a company and genuinely can’t do anything else. My first startup gave me so much autonomy that it basically made me unemployable - working anything that felt even remotely similar to a normal job was unbearable and super boring for me. I wanted to own way more of the decision-making, the company, and truly feel connected to the problem/customers."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(e.p,{children:"I like using the metaphor of being inside a box to describe the jobs I like vs dislike.

I’ve done that now, and no longer see my previous roles as an unbounded box. I think the next unbounded box is starting a company."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(e.p,{children:"I kept psyching myself out after that first startup experience and told myself that maybe what I wanted was closer to a regular job, “work-life balance”, and all the things people usually say they want out of life, only to quickly realize it wasn’t working for me. No one should sign up for the pain of starting a company unless it’s truly so compelling that they can’t help themselves, and I didn’t know I’d get to that point. I told myself for years that I’m better off being an operator at an early-stage company (because I still liked being early and owning many product decisions), but I thought I wasn’t “founder” material. It was only at the point where I felt a deep desperation to start a company and genuinely couldn’t be excited enough to do anything else that I realized I had to do it, and didn’t need to wait for anyone’s permission."})]})},"/posts/starting-a-company",{filePath:"pages/posts/starting-a-company.md",timestamp:1732650551e3,pageMap:r.v,frontMatter:{title:"Musings on starting a company",author:"Ani Ravi",date:"2024-10-02",tag:"Company, Startup",description:"When to start a company"},title:"Musings on starting a company"},"undefined"==typeof RemoteContent?s:RemoteContent.useTOC)},6047:function(t,e,a){"use strict";a.d(e,{v:function(){return o}});let o=[{name:"index",route:"/",frontMatter:{type:"page",title:"Home"}},{name:"posts",route:"/posts",children:[{name:"an-underrated-part-of-using-graphql",route:"/posts/an-underrated-part-of-using-graphql",frontMatter:{title:"An underrated part of using GraphQL",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(16760736e5),tag:"Programming, GraphQL, Libraries",description:"Consistent naming."}},{name:"first-product-journey",route:"/posts/first-product-journey",frontMatter:{title:"The short-lived journey of our first product",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(15821568e5),tag:"Pepper, Product, Startups",description:"The story of Pepper, our first app.",image:"/images/pepperlogo.png"}},{name:"index",route:"/posts",frontMatter:{type:"posts",title:"Posts"}},{name:"learning-graphql-through-postgraphile",route:"/posts/learning-graphql-through-postgraphile",frontMatter:{title:"Learning GraphQL through PostGraphile",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(15971904e5),tag:"GraphQL, PostGraphile",description:"You will learn about SQL too"}},{name:"long-term-vs-short-term-career-choices",route:"/posts/long-term-vs-short-term-career-choices",frontMatter:{title:"Long-term vs short-term career choices",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(17278272e5),tag:"Career, Life",description:"One potential path to long-term success"}},{name:"move-off-orms-in-typescript",route:"/posts/move-off-orms-in-typescript",frontMatter:{title:"Migrating away from query builders and ORMs in JavaScript and TypeScript",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(159192e7),tag:"ORMs, JavaScript, TypeScript",description:"Alternatives"}},{name:"software-engineering-in-the-early-days-of-a-product",route:"/posts/software-engineering-in-the-early-days-of-a-product",frontMatter:{title:"Software engineering in the early days of a product",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(16560288e5),tag:"Engineering, Technology",description:"Some things I've learned about building software in the early days of something new."}},{name:"special-about-haskell",route:"/posts/special-about-haskell",frontMatter:{title:"What’s special about Haskell?",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(16162848e5),tag:"Haskell, Programming, Languages",description:"What’s special about Haskell if you can already program in another language?"}},{name:"stand-out-engineering-team",route:"/posts/stand-out-engineering-team",frontMatter:{title:"How to make an engineering team stand out",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(17290368e5),tag:"Company, Startup, Engineering",description:"What many engineering teams seem to miss"}},{name:"starting-a-company",route:"/posts/starting-a-company",frontMatter:{title:"Musings on starting a company",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(17278272e5),tag:"Company, Startup",description:"When to start a company"}},{name:"the-future-of-typescript",route:"/posts/the-future-of-typescript",frontMatter:{title:"The future of TypeScript",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(16760736e5),tag:"TypeScript, Programming, Effect, Functional, Libraries",description:"This set of libraries will revolutionize how we write TypeScript."}},{name:"the-incredible-irony-of-dynamically-typed-languages",route:"/posts/the-incredible-irony-of-dynamically-typed-languages",frontMatter:{title:"The incredible irony of dynamically-typed languages",author:"Ani Ravi",date:new Date(16206912e5),tag:"Programming, Types, Languages, Dynamic",description:"Dynamically-typed programming sucks in a real, production codebase.
