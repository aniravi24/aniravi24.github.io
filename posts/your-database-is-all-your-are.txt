While NoSQL databases have their uses, this is often how they are misconstrued when beginners learn web dev (I fell into this trap too, a few years ago).

Everything you are as a project/company, everything you will be, is all encoded in that data you are storing, typically in your database or a third-party service you’re using. “Schemaless” databases for most new applications, especially ones where you only have one database and it is the primary one, is an outright mistake. If your data has no schema, why are you building anything in the first place? Data always has a schema — you only choose whether to make it implicit or explicit — when building most products, making it explicit makes a lot more sense. A lot of data tends to share some kind of relationship with other data. The best widespread tool we have to solve that problem is a relational database, like PostgreSQL."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["Don’t ignore the data and think that you can come back to it later.

Mongoose attempts to put a lackluster SQL-like layer on top of a “schemaless” database. What happens if the structure of your data changes? Then, you have to write a migration. When you have a database that enforces constraints and structure, writing migrations are much easier because it’s harder to make mistakes. When you have no structure and no constraints, you can run migrations in production that are halfway broken without even realizing they are wrong, wondering why your application suddenly stopped working."]}],"\n","$L9"]],null,"$La"]}],{},null,false]},null,false]},null,false]},null,false],"$Lb",false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$c",[]],"s":false,"S":true}
