Even though the laptop is repairable/upgradeable, it looked super well thought out, inside and out (and Iâ€™m not one that cares for the current trend of making laptops pointlessly thin, but donâ€™t want something really bulky if I can avoid it). Not just that, they thought through every little detail - giving you extra screws, making the screws that hold the back captive so that they donâ€™t detach from the case when you loosen them, giving you a screwdriver in the box that can unscrew every screw in the laptop, etc."]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"I later learned that Nirav was the head of hardware at Oculus and one of the first folks on the Oculus team.

Finally, a company had the know-how, talent, and mission to see this challenge through. You can tell this company is built by engineers and engineers-at-heart.
