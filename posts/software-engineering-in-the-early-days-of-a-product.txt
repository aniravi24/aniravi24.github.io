7:T613,When I first started building products, I used to get excited whenever people said they “hacked” something together. I thought it was a badge of honor to just get something working. I don’t hold that belief anymore. While there is a time and place for hacking things together (especially when you’re early and your only concern is building a product people actually want and get your business to go from “default dead” to “default alive”), there are some things that most people overlook in the early days and certain decisions that can be made that continue to affect your team longer than you think. If you’re really building something people want and you’ve gotten the signals that you are, take what you’re building more seriously - if people depend on your product, you can’t only be focused on the 1000 foot view of the product - the manufacturing and assembly matter more than people give it credit for in the early days. Sometimes I feel as though people who build physical products probably understand this more intuitively than people who build software - cause when a physical product sucks, wow can you feel it. Everyone else at your company has different priorities - someone wants to get something solved for a customer, someone else wants to improve the business, etc. But you, the software engineer? Your job is to build a high-quality experience that people can use to solve their problem and to write code that other team members feel empowered working with to continuously deliver those high-quality experiences.0:{"P":null,"b":"r2dO66GMTXiZsz162prV0","p":"","c":["","posts","software-engineering-in-the-early-days-of-a-product"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["posts",{"children":["software-engineering-in-the-early-days-of-a-product",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/e7579b16c1ac41a4.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],"$L2"]}],{"children":["posts",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["software-engineering-in-the-early-days-of-a-product",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Software engineering in the early days of a product"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"x:mb-8 x:flex x:gap-3 x:items-center","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:grow x:dark:text-gray-400 x:text-gray-600","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:flex x:flex-wrap x:items-center x:gap-1","children":["Ani Ravi",",",["$","time",null,{"dateTime":"2022-06-24T00:00:00.000Z","children":"6/24/2022"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"x:px-1","children":"•"}],[["$","$L5","Engineering",{"href":"/tags/Engineering","className":"nextra-tag","children":"Engineering"}],["$","$L5","Technology",{"href":"/tags/Technology","className":"nextra-tag","children":"Technology"}]]]}],"$undefined"]}],["$","$L6",null,{}]]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"I’ve been writing code more seriously for a few years now, initially starting off with projects built from the ground up, and more recently, working at a company where I work with a pre-existing codebase.
