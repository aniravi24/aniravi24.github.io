It’s easy to build a toy project and say that you learned how to use some new tool, library, or language quickly, but the real work in software engineering is in the last “10%”. It’s to make something run in a production environment, not just on your development machine. Have a view that sometimes renders correctly or has a strange breaking edge case that you notice? You can ignore that in a toy project, but it has to be taken care of for a proper experience in production. Your WebSockets don’t reconnect when the server restarts? You can handle this fine with a toy project — just restart the server.
