Anything that runs through PostGraphile’s autogenerated schema (not necessarily custom stuff you’ve written) also avoids N+1 query problems, as your GraphQL query is parsed into a SQL query prior to running against your database, keeping things performant. I saved a ton of time building with PostGraphile, and you get lots of interesting benefits doing things through DB-driven design. You could build say, a user-facing API and admin API largely just by setting database permissions per table, without having to write entire APIs or dealing with security for it separately. You can build a lot more a lot faster, especially as you aren’t spending time in your REST APIs thinking specifically about what query you need to write to get certain data.
