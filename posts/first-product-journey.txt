27:T455,We went back to the drawing board and decided to learn how to build a mobile app with React Native so we could create the experience we should’ve had from the start. We put our heads down and built out the app. Right before launch, we realized that some parts of our tech stack made things harder for us and we decided to spend a few days moving our entire JavaScript codebase (app and backend) from JavaScript to TypeScript, and moving from MongoDB to PostgreSQL. With TypeScript, we could actually get an idea of whether things worked by compiling the code first and having types instead of seeing the usual JS runtime errors (“undefined is not a function” is just my favorite). All of our data was relational, and it made no sense to use MongoDB. We also had to move off Stripe and use In-App Purchases (IAP) on Android and iOS. Apple declined our app when we tried using Stripe, but Google still approved it anyway and we might’ve gotten away with it for some time, but we decided to use IAP for both platforms. We also learned what it feels like to have Google and Apple take 30% of your revenue.d:["$","p",null,{"children":"$27"}]

28:T484, certain numbers by the digits you would see on a dial-pad (e.g. +266696687 means “ANONYMOUS”). Looking back, we mistakenly told several customers that the app wouldn’t work for them when it actually may have. This was because we had restricted all calls to only work inside the US due to the costs for going international and other concerns (but we could support you as long as you had a US phone number). We would see these strange numbers and not realize what was going on, and it took us a while to figure out that these specific numbers meant something. In another situation, we discovered that most of our customers on Apple devices were not getting any push notifications from us because we had missed one line of code in the app. With that situation, we only found out because we were looking at a churned customer’s info in the database and realized that the token for sending Apple notifications was missing for that customer, and ultimately most Apple customers. We got lucky that we found that issue as soon as we did, but we already had a bunch of customers at that point. These are just a few of many things that had our hair on fire.16:["$","p",null,{"children":["We discovered all sorts of things that we never knew before, more than I could possibly recall and enumerate here.

29:T413,Additionally, the way that our app works is that we have you forward all your calls to us, so we handle all incoming phone calls. We weren’t sure if the business model would work, given that we get charged per minute with all incoming calls. With our web MVP, we had an ugly pricing scheme with four tiers and usage-based pricing that was far too confusing for anyone to wrap their head around. When we launched the mobile app, we changed that to only be one option (flat-rate of $6/month), hoping it would cover our costs based on some rudimentary spreadsheet modeling we had done. So far, it seems like we’ve made money if you only look at the cost to make the product and the amount we’re charging customers (our margins aren’t as great as we would want though). We worried that this price might be too high, but we were (and currently are) college students that were bootstrapping this with our own money. We couldn’t afford to lose a lot of money on this, particularly when our costs had the possibility of being extremely high.18:["$","p",null,{"children":"$29"}]

2a:T551,Once January 2020 came along, app development was mainly focused on fixing major issues and we mostly stayed quiet. After some time, we weren’t confident about being able to scale this reliably since we didn’t own a good chunk of the product experience (because the heavy lifting was largely done by other services). We also recognized something that arguably was the most important thing in this particular situation — we didn’t care much about what we were building. We initially were motivated by the problem since it was personal to some degree, but we mostly built it because we like making things together, not because we were passionate about the problem. Robocalls are an extremely real problem, but it wasn’t one that we could see ourselves doing the gargantuan amount of work going forward to actually solve. We didn’t feel passionate enough about our own product to actually go sell to consumers. Remember, thus far, all the traffic we’ve gotten is organic and from launch sites like Product Hunt and BetaList (we still have people trickling in from those sites to the time of this writing).
