8:T86c,So how do you choose the right tools? I like to describe a codebase as a living, dynamical system. A human being is an example of such a system - our bodies are constantly going through different processes to keep us alive, and we have to consciously do work to perform at an optimal level (go to the gym, sleep properly, eat well, etc.). Similar to how your body evolves when you go to the gym, the only thing that‚Äôs constant about a great codebase being built from the ground up is a need to evolve. This is probably a heretical statement, because I‚Äôve seen many engineers praise great codebases on how little work needs to be done to them after things work. However, the reality of a small team or organization is that your work is just getting started, and more likely than not as your organization grows, you will need to evolve the codebase. The thing is, surprisingly often, engineers don‚Äôt seem to have the foresight to think about what the consequences are of choosing tools that are not suitable for growing teams, evolving problems, and evolving products. The tools you choose should allow you to confidently change any part of the system knowing that things are not going to break, and to iterate quickly. The truth about an early product is that you usually can‚Äôt (and shouldn‚Äôt) be solving scale problems at the beginning. But what you do want is a setup that‚Äôs capable of being evolved/improved. You‚Äôre not going to get every decision right, but it should be fixable over time instead of feeling like it‚Äôs going to fall apart at any second. High-leverage tools that let you punch well above your weight are probably the biggest unlock an engineering team can have - the most incredible thing about choosing high-leverage tools is that they also have a much greater likelihood of attracting great engineers (ask your favorite designer if they would choose Microsoft Paint over Figma/Photoshop). My favorite high-leverage tool is a language with a powerful type system like TypeScript (which also happens to come with a ton of additional tooling that I also use, such as linters, formatters, monorepos, unique libraries, etc.).9:T75b,One potentially counterintuitive thing I‚Äôve learned from working with great engineers is that good/great engineers can make fundamentally different decisions than mediocre engineers. Sometimes, mediocre engineers will judge a great engineer‚Äôs decision as a risky or bad decision, because they don‚Äôt have the skill to actually drive some of those decisions. For example, improving/rewriting things is commonplace with the right engineering team. Larger rewrites might still be less common, but deciding to improve something should just be part of how you operate. If an engineer wants to improve something in the codebase, they should be able to demonstrate that something can make things better and quickly get feedback from the team on whether to proceed. If it‚Äôs a larger change, they should be able to validate it within days/weeks, and not spend months making major changes that people can‚Äôt see the viability of. This iteration loop becomes even faster once your team aligns on your engineering principles and why you choose certain tools over others. On the first team I worked with, if someone could demonstrate improvement using a certain tool and got the team bought in, we would start moving to it (quickly weighing the tradeoff between time to migrate and resulting improvement). I would often do the initial slate of work myself so that I could build that muscle of constant, iterative improvement. The worst place to be is on a team where even minor decisions take forever - you‚Äôll have multiple meetings to decide on things that should take all of five minutes for a good team to move forward on with minimal discussion. A constant desire to improve and iterate gets baked into your culture when engineers actually see things get better. Great engineers tend to their garden without being asked and can still make amazing progress on the overall objectives.a:T43a,In a lot of poor codebases, issues are often caught only by users in production. In any decent codebase, the feedback to the engineer on what they might be doing wrong or need to change is as real-time as possible (i.e. seeing the error in your editor/compiler as your working on it, or being able to visually see changes). As many issues as possible should be solved at this first layer of defense. The next typical layers of defense are tests, then CI checks, then preview environments, then staging, QA, and so on and so forth. The thing is that most small teams don‚Äôt have time or the need to set up all of these layers of defense, so if you start from the first layers of defense on day 1, you‚Äôll have a much easier time adding the remaining ones as needed (and have fewer issues to fix). I‚Äôve also found that with poor tooling, it becomes painful to iterate on your product, the system grows increasingly brittle (hard to change and easily broken by any perturbation from the real world, such as users or external services), and user dissatisfaction increases over time.b:T434,It turns out when you get these details right, great things happen. It‚Äôs a positive domino effect. Great people want to come work with you, which results in more (and higher-quality) work getting done, more progress, more great people wanting to join‚Ä¶ and before you know it you‚Äôve increased the odds of success dramatically. Obviously it‚Äôs more complicated than this in practice, but those early decisions can completely change the trajectory of your organization. And surprisingly often people make all the opposite (suboptimal) decisions in the early days and forever kill the potential of their product/organization. Something many (especially non-technical) people don‚Äôt realize is a lot of those early decisions, when made poorly/sloppily to achieve short-term goals, typically have a negative domino effect. Those technical or hiring decisions rarely have a neutral or minor effect. In those scenarios, you need capable people to come in as soon as possible and stop/reverse the negative domino effect, otherwise you likely doom the potential of your product.c:T4ea,Ok this all sounds great, but what if your organization made all these bad decisions to get things started? It‚Äôs not too late to fix it if you have the decision-making power. It‚Äôs really important that you have the decision-making power to fix it otherwise the antibodies of the existing organization will kick in and probably drive you out for ‚Äúchanging too much‚Äù. The longer you wait, you‚Äôre unlikely to fundamentally change the DNA of an organization (which is what‚Äôs needed to build a great product) and fix all the fundamental issues which only get worse over time. No great engineer wants to be the person left holding the bag. It‚Äôs a gargantuan (maybe improbable) effort to ‚Äúfix‚Äù a non-existent product culture once a company has already grown. Assuming your company lasts long enough to actually fix that in the first place. Do not delay on this decision. The longer you wait, you significantly decrease the likelihood of not just success, but surviving altogether. It‚Äôs going to be a hard thing to fix with a lot of work required even if you try to correct it fairly early on, but it‚Äôs work that needs to be done if you want to significantly increase your likelihood of success (e.g. iterate more quickly, attract good people).d:T4c2,Most people have never worked with great engineers, and I‚Äôve found this easier to tease out over time in conversation. I can‚Äôt tell you the number of times in recent past I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúoh we just need to get things done, we‚Äôll write better code when we raise our series B, I‚Äôve seen other teams write garbage they fixed later on‚Äù. And guess what? To no one‚Äôs surprise, all of those teams tend to build low to mediocre quality products and either hire way more people than they need to (who are often mediocre), struggle to hire altogether, or just die - I wonder why this happens? üôÉ The common refrain is ‚Äúoh we need to focus on getting distribution and growing‚Äù - yeah‚Ä¶ like every other business ever created? Building a great product is a philosophical choice, something you have to decide matters to your organization. Every successful business needs to grow - it‚Äôs not mutually exclusive with building a great product. In fact, great products that solve a real problem often grow faster than ones that don‚Äôt. The speed vs. quality tradeoff is a myth on great teams. Engineers can work at a lot of successful companies - a much smaller number can say they truly worked on a great product.0:{"P":null,"b":"OLq-WbkFFtNU_EdijDKmk","p":"","c":["","posts","doing-great-product-engineering"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["posts",{"children":["doing-great-product-engineering",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/e7579b16c1ac41a4.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],"$L2"]}],{"children":["posts",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["doing-great-product-engineering",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Doing great product engineering"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"x:mb-8 x:flex x:gap-3 x:items-center","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:grow x:dark:text-gray-400 x:text-gray-600","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:flex x:flex-wrap x:items-center x:gap-1","children":["Ani Ravi",",",["$","time",null,{"dateTime":"2025-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","children":"2/11/2025"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"x:px-1","children":"‚Ä¢"}],[["$","$L5","Engineering",{"href":"/tags/Engineering","className":"nextra-tag","children":"Engineering"}],["$","$L5","Technology",{"href":"/tags/Technology","className":"nextra-tag","children":"Technology"}]]]}],"$undefined"]}],["$","$L6",null,{}]]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"I‚Äôve been lucky in my life to observe some great engineering teams, and to work with great people."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["This post is an attempt to put together the core threads of my learnings on what it takes to do great product engineering especially when you‚Äôre a smaller team.
