7:T419,If you’ve read my previous blog posts, you know that I’m generally biased toward languages that have strong static analysis tools, so less stuff gets put in production that isn’t verified by a compiler. However, it’s almost inevitable in your programming journey nowadays that you will work in some language with almost no static analysis tooling, at least at most young companies. As much as I love tools that can make programming more sane, it’s also the case that programming tools still have a lot of room for improvement, to help aid programmers rather than needing to spend too much time type-wrangling or dealing with unclear errors. I’ve been using Elixir for some time now, and used to have a more negative opinion of it starting out, primarily because dealing with constant runtime errors was super annoying (still is) and it felt slow to build new features when having to keep all the information in my head. While there are some shortcomings in terms of things I like having in a language, some of Elixir’s tools are great.0:{"P":null,"b":"dlIMIuT3r14m59T_ZPj7v","p":"","c":["","posts","using-elixir-in-production-at-a-small-startup"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["posts",{"children":["using-elixir-in-production-at-a-small-startup",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/e7579b16c1ac41a4.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],"$L2"]}],{"children":["posts",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["using-elixir-in-production-at-a-small-startup",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Some reflections on using elixir in production at a small startup"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"x:mb-8 x:flex x:gap-3 x:items-center","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:grow x:dark:text-gray-400 x:text-gray-600","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:flex x:flex-wrap x:items-center x:gap-1","children":["Ani Ravi",",",["$","time",null,{"dateTime":"2022-03-11T00:00:00.000Z","children":"3/11/2022"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"x:px-1","children":"•"}],[["$","$L5","Elixir",{"href":"/tags/Elixir","className":"nextra-tag","children":"Elixir"}],["$","$L5","Programming",{"href":"/tags/Programming","className":"nextra-tag","children":"Programming"}],["$","$L5","Languages",{"href":"/tags/Languages","className":"nextra-tag","children":"Languages"}]]]}],"$undefined"]}],["$","$L6",null,{}]]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"$7"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["Most people often talk about how networking tooling in Elixir is awesome, since communicating between processes and external servers is basically “built-in”, so network clustering in Elixir (especially for building things like chat apps) is much simpler than in other languages.

It’s actually one of the biggest reasons why we haven’t seriously looked at any other backend languages for our Elixir codebase - Ecto is just that much easier to use and makes writing new features that much faster (if anyone knows how I can get composable queries, reusable query fragments, helpers to write things like joins, and raw SQL-level performance from a language like Haskell or Rust, please let me know)!"]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["Ecto combined with ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe","target":"_blank","rel":"noreferrer","children":["Absinthe",[" ",["$","svg",null,{"fill":"none","stroke":"currentColor","strokeLinecap":"round","strokeLinejoin":"round","strokeWidth":1.7,"viewBox":"0 0 24 24","height":"1em","className":"x:inline x:align-baseline x:shrink-0","children":[["$","path",null,{"d":"M7 17L17 7"}],["$","path",null,{"d":"M7 7h10v10"}]]}]]],"className":"x:focus-visible:nextra-focus"}]," (Elixir’s premier GraphQL server library) is a really good combination to get you started - it reduces the amount of code you have to write significantly for doing data access and the performance is good enough.

It’s worthwhile to have periods of reflection to re-evaluate whether you’re using the best tools available to you to solve the problems ahead, and thinking through how much effort it would take to change tools if needed. Elixir is mostly a simple language to learn, and can get you started fairly quickly if that’s what you’re looking for. It’s also a decent gateway into some functional programming ideas, but if you’re looking for tooling that dives headfirst into FP ideas, I would look at other languages instead.
