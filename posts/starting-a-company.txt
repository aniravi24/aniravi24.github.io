7:T47f,Coming out of high school, I caught the startup bug - not enough to know what to do or have any useful skills, but I became captivated with founder stories and tried to surround myself with people that were doing things. Funny enough, some of those same people later told me they weren’t sure if I was just a “networker” or going to work on anything. Most people only ever get far enough to say they want to start a company, and never take any steps whatsoever to do it. What felt different for me is that I simply chased after what was interesting to me, and was willing to put any amount of effort necessary to keep doing things that were interesting to me. This led to me to joining my first startup (after trying to start my own company but not knowing what to work on, which fizzled out after building a couple small apps), where I got a one-of-a-kind experience. I don’t think I appreciated how unusual my experience was until I talked to more people and learned about their backgrounds (as well as hearing from former teammates about their current roles). The startup ultimately failed, but coming out of it, I wasn’t sure what to do.0:{"P":null,"b":"7Bo99VQW3qjJGEO105SV5","p":"","c":["","posts","starting-a-company"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["posts",{"children":["starting-a-company",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/dc8241de6474d86e.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],"$L2"]}],{"children":["posts",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","posts","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["starting-a-company",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children","posts","children","starting-a-company","children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","h1",null,{"children":"Musings on starting a company"}],["$","div",null,{"className":"x:mb-8 x:flex x:gap-3 x:items-center","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:grow x:dark:text-gray-400 x:text-gray-600","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"x:flex x:flex-wrap x:items-center x:gap-1","children":["Ani Ravi",",",["$","time",null,{"dateTime":"2024-10-02T00:00:00.000Z","children":"10/2/2024"}],["$","span",null,{"className":"x:px-1","children":"•"}],[["$","$L5","Company",{"href":"/tags/Company","className":"nextra-tag","children":"Company"}],["$","$L5","Startup",{"href":"/tags/Startup","className":"nextra-tag","children":"Startup"}]]]}],"$undefined"]}],["$","$L6",null,{}]]}],[["$","p",null,{"children":"Generally, I think people shouldn’t start companies, if you can find any easier way to accomplish what you want to do.
