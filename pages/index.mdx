## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ani, a software developer who loves statically-typed functional programming, and open-source software (my current favorite library ecosystem is [Effect-TS](https://effect.website/) for TypeScript).

Computers were built to aid us - naturally, they should help us build better programs. I care about building robust, maintainable software, and am motivated by hard problems, not building the next cool widget.
