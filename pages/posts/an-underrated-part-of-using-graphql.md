One thing that's underrated about using GraphQL over a REST API is that conventions are enforced (or highly recommended) with a GraphQL API. I was surprised when building apps with other engineers, realizing that engineers will sometimes use a different convention for every endpoint (and there weren't even that many endpoints). Camel case for one endpoint, snake case for another, kebab case for another, and then different casing for the query params..

GraphQL is nice because it standardizes all of this. Just that alone is such a useful aspect of using GraphQL that I underappreciated.
