# Personal website

Built with Next.js and [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).

Credit to [Frontend Web3](https://github.com/frontendweb3/nextra-blog) and [Effect-TS](https://effect.website) for the templates I could borrow from, and [mkrtchian](https://github.com/mkrtchian/reading-notes) for the `next export` example so I could make this a static site.
